# Xinjiang Concentration Camp Investigation<br/>新疆集中营调查

The Chinese Communist Party is persecuting Uyghurs, an ethnic minority in Xinjiang, China. The UN said many are locked into “re-education” camps without being charged or tried, under the pretext of anti-extremism. Even Islamic greetings can get a Uyghur in Xinjiang detained. Estimated numbers of prisoners range from tens of thousands to over a million.

Mass surveillance in Xinjiang also target Uyghurs. The police often stop them unreasonably and scan their phones. The government forcefully collect their biometric data, like DNA samples and iris scans. One UN expert called Xinjiang a “no rights zone” for Uyghurs. 

These atrocities appall us, so we decide to investigate the camps. We also document all companies, governments and people involved here.

## We’re planning to build a database and a website for our investigation this summer. Stay tuned!<br/>我们计划今夏建立调查数据库和网站，敬请期待！
